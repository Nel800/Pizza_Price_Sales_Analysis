## Project Title
Pizza_Price_Sales_Analysis

## Project Overview
This Project analyzes a pizza restaurant's sales dataset to uncover business insights such as total revenue, total orders, bestselling and worst-selling pizzas, peak sales hours, and sales performance by day of the week.
The goal is to demonstrate pratical data analysis skills using Python and Pandas, and to provide ninsights that can support business decisions such as menu optimization and sales strategy.

## Data Description
The data consists of four CSV files
- Order.csv - contains order ID, date and time of each order
- Order_details.csv - contains details of pizzas in each order (pizza ID and quantity)
- Pizzas.csv - contains pizza ID, size, and price.
- Pizza_type.csv - contains pizza name, category, and ingredients.
These files were merged using relational keys to form a single analytical dataset.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas(data cleaning & analysis)
- Matplotlib (visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed
Merged 4 CSV files into one dataset
Checked and handled missing values
Calculated:
- Total revenue
- Total quantity of pizzas sold
- Total number of orders
- Type of pizza type being sold
- Average price of pizzas
- Peak sales hour
- Total sales by day of the week
- Top 5 bestselling pizzas
- Sales made each month
- Worst 5 bestselling pizzas

## Key Insights
- The business generated significant revenue from the pizza sales across the period covered by the dataset
- Lunch hours recorded the hightest number of orders
- Sales peak on Fridays compared to other days of the week
- A small number of pizza types account for a large portion of total sales, while some pizzas underperform.

## Project Motivation

This project was completed as part of my learning journey in data analysis. I worked with the multiple CSV files, corrected mistakes during data merging and successfuly built an analyticaldataset to generate business insights.
